                                <a href = "#" style="color:#a00000;text-decoration: underline;">Falcon Northwest</a> stands as the elder statesman among custom PC builders, with a legacy dating 
                                back to 1992. While renowned for its high-performance desktops and laptops, it may not suit those on a tight budget due to its premium pricing. 
                                Their desktop options start around $2,900, with laptops beginning at approximately $2,700. Each system boasts a standard 3-year warranty and offers 
                                customization options both in hardware and aesthetics, including custom-painted cases.
                                <br><br>
                                However, despite its reputation for quality, Falcon Northwest's price-to-performance ratio may not be as favorable compared to some competitors. 
                                For instance, their entry-level Fragbox desktop, priced at $2,900, features specifications that may not justify the cost when compared to other options. 
                                Moreover, Falcon Northwest doesn't provide financing options, necessitating full payment upfront via credit card.
                                <br><br>
                                <a href = "#"><img style="border-radius: 10px;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" class="card-img-top" src="{% static "images/knowledge_base/The 12 Best Custom PC Builder Websites/falcon_northwest_2.JPG" %}" alt="..." /></a>

                                Nonetheless, Falcon Northwest's commitment to excellence shines through its unique offerings. The company's custom desktop cases, engineered for 
                                optimal thermal management with minimal plastic, set it apart. The FragBox PC, emblematic of Falcon Northwest's engineering prowess, combines 
                                portability with robust performance capabilities. Despite its higher price tag, Falcon Northwest remains a top choice for those prioritizing design, 
                                customization, and performance in their custom PC builds.

                                <a href = "#" style="color:#a00000;text-decoration: underline;">Build My PC</a> distinguishes itself from other platforms as it functions primarily as a PC 
                                part compatibility verifier rather than a custom PC assembler. Integrated directly with Amazon, its builder tool enables users to select components from 
                                Amazon's inventory and construct a personalized configuration. Following component selection, the tool assesses compatibility and facilitates adding 
                                chosen parts to the user's Amazon cart.

                                In addition to its compatibility checker, BuildMyPC provides a range of prebuilt laptop and desktop systems. However, 
                                it lacks filtering options for these products, restricting users to utilizing the search bar to locate specific parts.

                                <h3>Should I verify the compatibility of PC parts before assembling my PC?</h3>
                                <p> 
                                    Ensuring compatibility is crucial, especially regarding the motherboard. Before proceeding with any purchases or assembly, 
                                    it's essential to check compatibility to avoid potential issues such as the system failing to boot.

                                <h3>How does the process work if I select my own components for the PC build on these websites?</h3>

                                <h3>Is it essential to invest in an extended warranty?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Typically, standard warranties cover builds and parts for one to three years. 
                                    Opting out of an extended warranty can help you avoid additional expenses.

                                <h3>What is the typical lifespan of a gaming PC once it's built?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The longevity of a custom gaming PC varies based on its hardware specifications. Generally, lower-end gaming PCs may last around 3 years, 
                                    while higher-end builds can maintain satisfactory performance for over 8 years. Additionally, the lifespan of individual components varies; 
                                    for instance, GPUs may require upgrades every 5 to 7 years, whereas well-maintained motherboards can endure for up to 20 years.

                                <h3> What is the typical lifespan of a CPU used for gaming?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    When a CPU is not subjected to overclocking and is adequately cooled,
                                    it can maintain functionality for gaming purposes for approximately 5 to 10 years or more.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Is it advisable to leave a PC running continuously for 24 hours a day?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Keeping your PC operational 24/7 can potentially lead to wear and tear, particularly due to the frequent cycling of power. 
                                    However, if you have ongoing tasks or processes that require the computer's continuous operation, it's generally acceptable to 
                                    leave it running. It's essential to maintain good ventilation in the room where the PC is located and regularly monitor the temperature of 
                                    its components to prevent overheating issues.
