                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                In this guide, we'll suggest the <a href="{% url "coming-soon" %}" style="color:#a00000;text-decoration: underline;">top gaming PC</a> setup for less than $600 and explain everything needed to turn a set of hardware pieces into
                                a fully functional gaming setup. We regularly update our recommendations to include the latest and best hardware options within the budget.
                                Although $600 is still considered entry-level, there's room to upgrade to a better <a href="{% url "coming-soon" %}" style="color:#a00000;text-decoration: underline;">graphics card</a>.
                                <br><br>
                                But before we delve into the hardware details, let's quickly discuss the performance and features you can expect from this PC.
                                Additionally, we'll touch on what makes our build unique and the compromises we made to maximize performance within the budget.

                                <hr>
                                <h3>PC hardware deals</h3>
                                <br>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                    When building your next gaming PC, snagging deals on certain components is a smart way to get more bang for your buck.
                                    You can scout for discounts on GPUs, CPUs, coolers, motherboards, power supplies, and cases. Even outside of big sales events,
                                    there are often savings to be had, allowing you to shave off a few bucks here and there.

                                <h3>PC Budget</h3>
                                <br>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                    As with all our builds, the main priority is to recommend a PC parts list that falls within the specified budget, which in this case is $600.
                                    While that might seem like a decent budget, it's actually quite challenging to put together a capable rig at this price point.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This means we had to make some compromises with this build to stay within the $600 limit. We opted for an older CPU and GPU combination and
                                    included a smaller SSD to keep costs down. However, despite these compromises, the build we've outlined below is currently the best option
                                    under $600 and offers easy upgradeability in the future.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Performance</h3>
                                <br>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                    For many people, the most crucial aspect of a custom PC build is its performance. After considering the price, the next thing to think about is how powerful
                                    the build is and whether it justifies the cost. With a relatively strong GPU for 1080p gaming and a capable multicore processor,
                                    this build offers everything you need to play most games smoothly. However, if you plan on gaming at higher resolutions like 1440p or above,
                                    you might need a more powerful setup. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Our build comes with a reasonably fast SSD storage solution, so you won't experience long boot times or slow game loading.
                                    However, you might want to expand its storage capacity in the future. Overall, given the current limitations and constraints,
                                    we're quite pleased with the performance of our $600 custom PC.

                                <h3>AMD vs Intel</h3>
                                <br>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                    You might be curious why we've suggested an Intel CPU for this build. The CPU we've chosen is budget-friendly and, although
                                    it's from a previous generation, it still delivers solid performance. Naturally, opting for this CPU allows us to prioritize
                                    fitting a better GPU into the build.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Regarding the ongoing debate between AMD and Intel, it's essential to consider upgrade options. Currently, the motherboard
                                    we've selected offers the potential to upgrade to a superior CPU in the future, along with faster RAM if needed.
                                    This provides some flexibility for enhancing the build down the line.

                                        Alternatively, you can use your SSD as a cache. SSDs provide significant performance improvements for desktop usage, faster boot times,
                                        and much quicker loading times in games. With a 500GB capacity, this SSD offers plenty of space for your media files and games.
                                        However, you may need to consider upgrading or adding more storage in the future.

                                Now that you've got a good grasp of how this build performs and what parts it includes, you're probably starting to figure out if
                                it's right for you. But before you make up your mind, there are some important things to think about.
                                <br><br>
                                Let's break down the key points you need to consider before deciding whether this build is the right choice for you.
                                By looking at these factors closely, you can make sure it matches your gaming needs perfectly.

                                So, let's jump in and talk about what you need to know before you buy this build.

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                We've previously mentioned the budget constraints at the beginning of this article, but one thing we didn't delve into was the relationship between a PC's
                                price and the performance it delivers. Each build offers varying levels of performance, so selecting the right PC should begin with considering its price.
                                We aimed for a budget under $600 and believe we've achieved the highest level of performance possible within this price range. Our build is capable of delivering
                                an immersive gaming experience at 1080p across popular AAA titles, often achieving over 60FPS. However, if you're seeking a PC for high-end tasks like
                                4k gaming, VR, and heavy multitasking simultaneously, you may want to explore one of our <a href="{% url "coming-soon" %}" style="color:#a00000;text-decoration: underline;">premium builds</a>.

                            <br>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                For first-time builders, it's essential to consider how easy a custom build is to assemble. Some projects can be more complex than others.
                                Our build utilizes builder-friendly cases, making the assembly process easier. With features like a PSU shroud, life is automatically made a bit simpler,
                                and <a href="{% url "coming-soon" %}" style="color:#a00000;text-decoration: underline;">cable management</a> is fairly straightforward as well.

                                to demonstrate how to use it effectively. Additionally, each build includes its own stock cooler with pre-applied thermal paste. However,
                                if you're interested in <a href="{% url "coming-soon" %}" style="color:#a00000;text-decoration: underline;">premium thermal paste</a>, we've got you covered as well.

                            <br>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Before purchasing a custom build, one of the crucial factors to consider is its upgradability and future-proofing. You don't want to end up in a
                                situation where upgrading your build becomes overly complicated. Fortunately, we've already taken this into account for you. The components we've chosen
                                for our build are open to expansion, allowing for additional storage, faster RAM, larger GPUs, and even better CPUs in the future.

                            <h3>Overclocking</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Overclocking can provide a significant performance boost to your build without any extra cost, which is undoubtedly appealing.
                                However, it's essential to understand that overclocking comes with risks, especially if you're not familiar with it.
                                Using incompatible hardware or improper settings can lead to serious consequences.
                                <br><br>
                                If you're considering overclocking your build, there are a few key factors to keep in mind. Cooling is crucial.
                                While both of our builds come with a stock cooler that can handle a small amount of overclocking, if you plan to push your CPU further,
                                investing in a more <a href="{% url "coming-soon" %}" style="color:#a00000;text-decoration: underline;">powerful cooling solution</a> is highly recommended.
                            </p>
                            <hr>
                            <h3>Non-Gaming Performance</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                We've confirmed that our build excels in gaming, but how does it perform in other areas like multitasking and handling heavy workloads?
                                The answer is quite promising. The AMD chip in our build is better suited for multitasking and handling heavy workloads,
                                thanks to its multi-threaded nature. This aspect is worth considering before purchasing because many <a href="{% url "budget-pc-builds" %}" style="color:#a00000;text-decoration: underline;">entry-level builds</a> struggle with heavy workloads.
                            </p>

                                Lastly, let's talk about aesthetics. Typically, aesthetics receive less attention when building an entry-level PC because visually appealing hardware
                                often comes with a higher price tag. However, we've still managed to include an attractive case with <a href="{% url "coming-soon" %}" style="color:#a00000;text-decoration: underline;">tempered glass</a> in this build.
                                If you're interested in enhancing the aesthetic appeal of your build, adding <a href="{% url "coming-soon" %}" style="color:#a00000;text-decoration: underline;">RGB fans</a> and lighting strips can really <a href="{% url "coming-soon" %}" style="color:#a00000;text-decoration: underline;">elevate the look of your PC</a>.
