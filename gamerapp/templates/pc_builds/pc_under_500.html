                                Whenever someone asks us how little they can spend on a good gaming computer, we always say $500.
                                That's because $500 is the cheapest you can go while still getting a computer with a separate graphics card, which is super important for gaming.
                                Sure, you could try to find a cheaper graphics card, but it wouldn't be any better than the graphics already built into most modern processors, and it might even cost more.
                                <br><br>
                                Now, we know it's not easy to find computer parts these days, especially graphics cards. So, this build might not look exactly like it would have before things got chaotic.
                                But we've still managed to put together a computer that can handle any new game out there.
                                <br><br>
                                So, if you want to know what this computer looks like and how well it works, just keep reading.

                                Building a gaming PC for less than $500 is pretty tough because you have to make every dollar count to get
                                decent performance. If you're new to building custom PCs, it might seem a bit overwhelming at first,
                                but don't worry! We've put together an easy guide to help you build the best gaming PC for under $500.
                                It'll make sure you have all the parts you need to create a great entry-level gaming setup that suits your needs.
                                Plus, with this affordable build, you'll still be able to play a wide range of games.

                                In today's world of technology, you might be surprised at what you can get with a $500 budget.
                                Gone are the days when you could only afford consoles or APUs. Now, you can build a PC under $500 that comes
                                with its own dedicated graphics card. While many of the components in this PC are considered entry-level and
                                from older generations, we still think they do a good job for the price. Just remember to keep your expectations
                                realistic at this price point.

                                    Putting together the ultimate custom PC for under $500 was definitely a challenge. We had to make a lot
                                    of trade-offs to squeeze out the best performance possible from this build. But we made it happen! With
                                    this budget, it's totally doable to create a gaming PC with its own dedicated graphics card.
                                    And let me tell you, the difference in performance between a $400 build and a $500 build is huge once you
                                    step away from integrated graphics. At the $500 mark, we were even able to include spacious M.2 SSDs and 16GB of RAM.
                                    <br><br>
                                    When it came to choosing a case, we had to be mindful of our budget. While we opted for affordable options,
                                    we still made sure to select a case that's easy to work with for first-time builders. Plus, we wanted to ensure
                                    good airflow to keep everything running smoothly.

                                    With this $500 build, you can expect smooth gaming at 1080p with 60 frames per second on many AAA titles,
                                    even at high settings. Plus, it'll breeze through popular esports games effortlessly, giving you plenty
                                    of entry-level options to explore. If you're into esports, you can even achieve high frame rates by
                                    tweaking the settings a bit. Overall, this budget PC is quite versatile. We've boosted its performance with 
                                    16GB of RAM, which is perfect for gaming, and included an SSD for fast boot times and snappy performance in
                                    both Windows and your games. Plus, the ample RAM provides some future-proofing for your system.

                                    The $500 gaming PC build makes smart use of budget-friendly, older-generation components.
                                    While you might need to adjust graphical settings for certain games to run smoothly, our tests
                                    showed that esports titles performed admirably at 1080p resolution.

                                    Intel's i3 processors are a great choice for building affordable systems. Although some older AMD Ryzen 5
                                    processors may still be tempting, we believe the CPU selected for this build offers superior price-to-performance ratio.

                                        Intel's 12th generation series isn't the newest anymore, but they still use the latest LGA 1700 socket, making them a solid choice for entry-level
                                        PC builders. Our top pick from this series is the Core i3-12100F.

                                        This processor comes with 4 cores and 8 threads, running at a base speed of 3.3GHz and can be boosted up to 4.3GHz.
                                        It offers decent performance for single-core tasks, making it perfect for entry-level gaming PCs. Plus, its multi-threaded capability
                                        means it's also good for handling other computing tasks.

                                        We're able to include a dedicated GPU for under $500, namely the AMD RX 6600. While it's considered entry-level,
                                        it still delivers solid performance at 1080p resolution, regardless of the settings. While you may need to manage your
                                        expectations for AAA games, this card excels when it comes to esports titles.

                                        For a custom build within this price range, the MSI Pro H610M-G motherboard is an excellent choice.
                                        While it may not be considered top-tier, it still comes with a variety of features and is future-proof for upgrades down the line.
                                        Plus, given the budget constraints, it's perfectly suited for this build. Additionally, motherboards don't significantly impact gaming performance,
                                        making it a suitable fit for this setup.

                                        Like many builds in this price range, our $500 custom build requires some compromises to ensure performance meets expectations.
                                        In this case, storage capacity has been slightly reduced. We've selected the WD Blue SN580 500GB SSD, which provides fast load and boot times.
                                        While this size is sufficient for your operating system and a few modern games, you might want to consider expanding storage in the future.

                                        Regrettably, our $500 build couldn't accommodate a modular PSU. However, for most system builders, modular PSUs aren't essential.
                                        The Thermaltake Toughpower GX2 600W PSU we've chosen will efficiently power this machine for years.

                                        The Cooler Master Q300L PC Case is a prime example of affordability. While it might not win any awards,
                                        it still provides decent airflow out of the box and has a user-friendly design. It's a sturdy case that should

                                        it offers everything you need for this build at a budget-friendly price. You might consider adding an extra fan for the rear of the
                                        case to improve airflow, but it's not essential until you upgrade your GPU.

                                Now that you've got a good grasp of how this build performs and what parts it includes, you're probably starting to figure out if
                                it's right for you. But before you make up your mind, there are some important things to think about.
                                <br><br>
                                Let's break down the key points you need to consider before deciding whether this build is the right choice for you.
                                By looking at these factors closely, you can make sure it matches your gaming needs perfectly.
                                <br><br>
                                So, let's jump in and talk about what you need to know before you buy this build.
                            </p>
                            <br><br>
                            <h3>$500 Budget</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Before diving into any PC purchase, it's crucial to consider your budget. That means asking yourself if you'll be able to build a PC that
                                meets your performance needs with the money you've set aside. Some folks believe that $500 will get them the ultimate gaming rig that
                                can handle VR and 4K gaming at 100FPS. Unfortunately, that's not the reality.
                                <br><br>
                                However, we've designed these custom PCs to handle a range of game titles in 1080p resolution. While FPS (frames per second) may vary depending on
                                the game's demands, you can achieve playable FPS if you optimize the settings just right.

                            <br>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                For first-time builders, it's essential to consider how challenging the assembly process might be. That's why we've chosen
                                a case that's beginner-friendly, with solid build quality to make the build process easier. Surprisingly, cable management was
                                fairly straightforward, and the pre-installed standoff screws helped speed up the entire process.
                                <br><br>
                                To assist with assembling the build, we used an iFixit PC building toolkit. Additionally, it's worth noting that for first-time builders,

                            <h3>Upgradability And Future-Proofing</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Another important aspect of a custom PC build is how easily you can upgrade it in the future. As many of you may already be aware,
                                technology is advancing rapidly, and games are becoming more demanding both in terms of computation and storage space.
                                That's why we've designed this PC with upgrades and future-proofing in mind.
                                <br><br>
                                Building a PC at this price point can make it challenging to future-proof the setup. However, we've selected a motherboard
                                that can accommodate additional storage drives, more powerful GPUs, better CPUs, and extra RAM if you decide to upgrade later on.
                                This ensures that your PC can adapt to the evolving demands of technology and gaming.

                            <h3>Overclocking</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                We're all familiar with overclocking—it's a method of boosting your build's performance by manually increasing the clock speed,
                                voltage, and timings of your hardware, all without any extra cost. However, what many people may not realize is that not all hardware
                                is designed for overclocking. Just ask our friendly video guy who recently pushed an entry-level motherboard a bit too far.
                                <br><br>
                                When it comes to overclocking your hardware, you need to proceed with caution. Our build is designed for light overclocking and
                                can respond to manual overclocking if you install a better CPU cooler. However, it's worth noting that both of these chips are already
                                quite well optimized, so squeezing out significant real-world performance gains might be a bit tricky.

                            <h3>Non-Gaming Performance</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Keep in mind that this build isn't just for gaming, although gaming is its primary focus. We've also considered
                                its capability to handle demanding workstation tasks and multitasking activities. With the powerful CPU and
                                ample RAM included in this build, tasks like live streaming and video editing should be a breeze.
                                <br><br>
                                When it comes to browsing and media tasks, this build handles them effortlessly. However, where you might
                                notice a drop in performance is when rendering large video files. If you anticipate doing a lot of that kind of work,
                                we'd suggest upgrading to a more powerful processor.

                                Last but not least, let's talk about the aesthetics of the build. In affordable builds, aesthetics often take a back seat,
                                as stylish designs typically come with a higher price tag. Unfortunately, this build features an entry-level case that,
                                to be honest, isn't the most visually appealing case we've come across. However, while it may lack in aesthetics,
                                it makes up for it with its user-friendly design.

                            <h3>$500 Custom Gaming PC vs Prebuilt</h3>
                            <br>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Building your own gaming PC typically provides better value, but we understand that not everyone wants to tackle the challenge of
                                building one from scratch. Lately, stock availability has also become a bit of an issue, making it tougher than ever to assemble your
                                own gaming PC. This is where a $500 prebuilt gaming PC might come in handy, but there are a few things to consider first.
                                <br><br>
                                Firstly, it's important to realize that you probably won't get the same level of performance from a prebuilt PC at the same price point.
                                If you spend your $500 on a prebuilt system, you'll likely get a lower-end CPU with fewer cores/threads, possibly less RAM and storage
                                capacity, and lower-quality PC cases and components.
                                <br><br>
                                This is because prebuilt manufacturers are businesses, and they make a profit by adding a markup (labor costs) to prebuilt computers.
                                While this is understandable, it can affect the overall value you get, especially when every penny counts at the lower end of the price range.
